# The Cost of Basic Goods

In this assignment, we model the cost of groceries in different neighborhoods of Berlin. Does
the store brand affect product prices, or not? Are grocery prices and the geographical distribution of
different grocery stores correlated with other cost-of-living measures in a city — for example, rent and
real estate prices? 

**Questions to answer:**

* What is the basic average price for each product?
* How much does each of the following factors modify the basic price of the product (up or down)?
  * Brand of the grocery store.
  * The geographical location of the grocery store.
  * Does price variation by geographical location correlate with variation in rental prices or not? Use a map of rental prices in Berlin by U-Bahn and S-Bahn station.
